qTwitter is a simple application allowing to use twitter.com social networking website. It is intended to imitate Twitterrific, known very well to Mac OS X users. It's being developed in C++ with Qt libraries (v. 4.4.3).

Features' summary as for v0.3.1:
  - posting updates to Twitter and downloading friends or public timeline,
  - support for deleting messages,
  - support for downloading direct messages,
  - customisable look (via the use of themes),
  - in-session password storing,
  - HTTP proxy support,
  - being recognized as a source of updates,
  - translation to 4 languages in the run-time (sorry for my poor Catalan/Spanish, I appreciate any help here :) ).

See CHANGELOG for details.

Please let me know about anything that doesn't work properly, or that should be implemented to make this app better.


Thanks for your time reading this and trying qTwitter!
