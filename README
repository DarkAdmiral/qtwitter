qTwitter is a simple application allowing to use twitter.com social networking website. It is intended to imitate Twitterrific, known very well to MacOS X users. It's being developed in C++ with Qt libraries (v. 4.4.3).

Features summary as for v0.1:
  - downloading friends or public timeline,
  - in-session password storing,
  - posting status updates to Twitter,
  - HTTP proxy support,
  - being recognized as a source of updates,
  - translations to 4 languages in the run-time (sorry for my poor Catalan/Spanish, I appreciate any help here :) ).

Current to-do list:
  * support for hyperlinks (including color change :P ),
  * support for homepage button on Linux,
  * adding a menu for tweets (reply-to, user's homepage, delete, etc.),
  * ...?

Please let me know about anything that doesn't work properly, or that should be implemented to make this app better.


Thanks for your time reading this and trying qTwitter!
