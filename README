qTwitter is a simple application allowing to use twitter.com social networking website. It is intended to imitate Twitterrific, known very well to MacOS X users. It's being developed in C++ with Qt libraries (v. 4.4.3).

The project is still in deep alpha phase (I don't even call it v. 0.1), although it provides basic functionality already.

Features summary:
  - downloading friends or public timeline,
  - in-session password storing,
  - posting status updates to Twitter,
  - HTTP proxy support,
  - being recognized as a source of updates.

To-do list for now:
  * settings section correction and extension,
  * tray icon,
  * support for hyperlinks,
  * i18n scheme correction,
  * ...?


Thanks for your time reading this and trying qTwitter!
