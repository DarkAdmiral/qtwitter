qTwitter is a simple application allowing to use twitter.com social networking website. It is intended to imitate Twitterrific, known very well to Mac OS X users. It's being developed in C++ with Qt libraries (v. 4.4.3).

Features' summary as for v0.2:
  - posting updates to Twitter and downloading friends or public timeline,
  - updates displaying independent on images downloading,
  - in-session password storing,
  - HTTP proxy support,
  - being recognized as a source of updates,
  - translation to 4 languages in the run-time (sorry for my poor Catalan/Spanish, I appreciate any help here :) ).

Please let me know about anything that doesn't work properly, or that should be implemented to make this app better.


Thanks for your time reading this and trying qTwitter!
