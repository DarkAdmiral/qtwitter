qTwitter is a simple application allowing to use twitter.com social networking website. It is intended to imitate Twitterrific, known very well to MacOS X users. It's being developed in C++ with Qt libraries (v. 4.4.3).

The project is still in deep alpha phase (I don't even call it v. 0.1), although it provides basic functionality already.

Features summary:
  - downloading friends timeline (together with avatars, at last :) )
  - posting status updates to Twitter,
  - HTTP proxy support,
  - being recognized as a source of updates.

The to-do list for now includes getting deeply into http request processing, as it makes application crash in some circumstances. Also, a clear i18n scheme has to be implemented, as for now it's just a huge mess... I'm still working on everything, but having work and living a real life, apart from programming, I can't devote too much time to having fun with Qt <- as this is what I mainly look for in writing this app :) Thanks for your time reading this and trying qTwitter!
