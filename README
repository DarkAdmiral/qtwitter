qTwitter is a simple application allowing to use twitter.com social networking website. It is intended to imitate Twitterrific, known very well to MacOS users. It's being written in C++ with Qt libraries (v. 4.4.0).

The project is still in deep initial state (I'm not even calling it v. 0.1), although it provides basic functionality already.

Features summary:
  - downloading friends timeline,
  - posting status updates to Twitter,
  - HTTP proxy support.
  
Currently I'm working on getting profile images downloading working in threaded environment, then I'll stick to improving user-friendliness and expanding functionality.

Thanks for your time taking a look at this app.
