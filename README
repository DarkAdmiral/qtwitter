qTwitter is a simple application allowing to use twitter.com social networking website. It is intended to imitate Twitterrific, known very well to MacOS X users. It's being written in C++ with Qt libraries (v. 4.4.0).

The project is still in deep initial state (I'm not even calling it v. 0.1), although it provides basic functionality already.

Features summary:
  - downloading friends timeline,
  - posting status updates to Twitter,
  - HTTP proxy support,
  - being recognized as a source of updates.

Currently I'm focused on getting profile images downloading working in threaded environment, then I'll stick to improving user-friendliness and expanding functionality.


HOW TO INSTALL:

To compile qTwitter you'll need Qt package version 4.4.0 or newer. Follow the steps:

1. Get the qTwitter source code from GitHub.
2. Enter the source code main directory.
3. Type:

  # qmake
  # make
  
4. It's done! Open qTwitter via "qtwitter" (UNIX), "qtwitter.app" (MacOS X) or "release\qtwitter.exe" (Windows).
5. Have fun :-)


Thanks for your time taking a look at this app.
